<H1>Abstract</H1>

<P>
This SRFI
<!--begin srfi-21
is a real-time extension to <a href="../srfi-18/">SRFI 18</a>,
"Multithreading support".  It
<!--end srfi-21-->
defines the following multithreading datatypes for Scheme
<UL>
<LI>Thread
<LI>Mutex
<LI>Condition variable
<LI>Time
</UL>
</P>

<P>
It also defines a mechanism to handle exceptions and some
multithreading exception datatypes.
</P>

<!--begin distinct-types
<H1>Issues</H1>

<UL>

<LI>Should the datatypes be distinct from all other Scheme datatypes,
i.e.  if any of the predicates listed in Section 3.2 of the R5RS is
true of <CODE><I>obj</I></CODE>, then <CODE>thread?</CODE>,
<CODE>mutex?</CODE>, etc are false of <CODE><I>obj</I></CODE>.

</UL>
<!--end distinct-types-->

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<P>
Multithreading is a paradigm that is well suited for building complex
systems such as: servers, GUIs, and high-level operating systems.  All
thread systems, including the one proposed here, offer mechanisms for
creating new threads of execution and for synchronizing them.
Mechanisms for controlling access privileges for various operations
are also usually provided by thread systems.  This SRFI does not
include such access control mechanisms because it aims to provide
basic mechanisms on top of which higher-level abstractions can be
built.
<!--begin srfi-21
Features which are useful in a real-time context, such as
priorities and priority inheritance, are specified in this SRFI.
<!--end srfi-21-->
</P>

<P>
This SRFI also specifies a datatype for time which is useful on its
own but is also required for specifying absolute synchronization
timeouts.  Mechanisms to handle exceptions and some multithreading
exception datatypes are also provided because exceptions are closely
tied to the multithreading model.
</P>

<H1>Specification</H1>

<P>
The thread system provides the following data types:
<UL>
<LI>Thread (a virtual processor which shares object space with all other
threads)
<!--begin thread-groups
<LI>Thread group (a collection of threads)
<!--end thread-groups-->
<LI>Mutex (a mutual exclusion device, also known as a lock and binary
semaphore)
<LI>Condition variable (a set of blocked threads)
<LI>Time (an absolute point on the time line)
</UL>
</P>

<P>
Some multithreading exception datatypes are also specified, and a
general mechanism for handling exceptions.
</P>

<H4>Threads</H4>

<P>
A "running" thread is a thread that is currently executing.  There can
be more than one running thread on a multiprocessor machine.  A
"runnable" thread is a thread that is ready to execute or running.  A
thread is "blocked" if it is waiting for a mutex to become unlocked,
an I/O operation to become possible, the end of a "sleep" period, etc.
A "new" thread is a thread that has not yet become runnable.  A new
thread becomes runnable when it is started.  A "terminated" thread is
a thread that can no longer become runnable (but "deadlocked" threads
are not considered terminated).  The only valid transitions between
the thread states are from new to runnable, between runnable and
blocked, and from any state to terminated:
<PRE>
                         unblock
       start            &lt;-------
  NEW -------&gt; RUNNABLE -------&gt; BLOCKED
    \             |      block  /
     \            v            /
      +-----&gt; TERMINATED &lt;----+
</PRE>
</P>

<!--begin srfi-21
<P>
Each thread has a "base priority", which is a real number (where a
higher numerical value means a higher priority), a "priority boost",
which is a non-negative real number representing the priority increase
applied to a thread when it blocks, and a "quantum", which is a
non-negative real number representing a duration in seconds.
</P>
<!--end srfi-21-->

<P>
Each thread has a "specific" field which can be used in an application
specific way to associate data with the thread (some thread systems
call this "thread local storage").
</P>

<H4>Mutexes</H4>

<P>
A mutex can be in one of four states: locked (either owned or not
owned) and unlocked (either abandoned or not abandoned).  An attempt
to lock a mutex only succeeds if the mutex is in an unlocked state,
otherwise the current thread must wait.  A mutex in the locked/owned
state has an associated "owner" thread, which by convention is the
thread that is responsible for unlocking the mutex (this case is
typical of critical sections implemented as "lock mutex, perform
operation, unlock mutex").  A mutex in the locked/not-owned state is
not linked to a particular thread.  A mutex becomes locked when a
thread locks it using the <CODE>mutex-lock!</CODE> primitive.  A mutex
becomes unlocked/abandoned when the owner of a locked/owned mutex
terminates.  A mutex becomes unlocked/not-abandoned when a thread
unlocks it using the <CODE>mutex-unlock!</CODE> primitive.  The mutex
primitives specified in this SRFI do not implement "recursive" mutex
semantics; an attempt to lock a mutex that is locked implies that the
current thread must wait even if the mutex is owned by the current
thread (this can lead to a deadlock if no other thread unlocks the
mutex).
</P>

<P>
Each mutex has a "specific" field which can be used in an application
specific way to associate data with the mutex.
</P>

<H4>Condition variables</H4>

<P>
A condition variable represents a set of blocked threads.  These
blocked threads are waiting for a certain condition to become true.
When a thread modifies some program state that might make the
condition true, the thread unblocks some number of threads (one or all
depending on the primitive used) so they can check the value of the
condition.  This allows complex forms of interthread synchronization
to be expressed more conveniently than with mutexes alone.
</P>

<P>
Each condition variable has a "specific" field which can be used in an
application specific way to associate data with the condition
variable.
</P>

<H4>Fairness</H4>

<P>
In various situations the scheduler must select one thread from a set
of threads (e.g. which thread to run when a running thread blocks or
expires its quantum, which thread to unblock when a mutex unlocks or a
condition variable is signaled).  The constraints on the selection
process determine the scheduler's "fairness".  Typically the selection
depends on the order in which threads become runnable or blocked and
on some "priority" attached to the threads.
</P>

<!--begin srfi-18-->
<P>
Because we do not wish to preclude extensions to this SRFI (such as
for real-time multithreading) that require specific fairness
constraints, there are no fairness constraints imposed by this SRFI.
It is expected however that implementations of Scheme that support
this SRFI will document the fairness constraints they provide.
</P>
<!--end srfi-18-->

<!--begin srfi-21
<P>
The fairness specified by this SRFI requires a notion of time
ordering, i.e. "event A occured before event B".  For the purpose of
establishing time ordering, the system may use a clock with a discrete,
possibly variable, resolution (a "tick").  Events occuring in a given
tick can be considered to be simultaneous (i.e. if event A occured
before event B in real time, then the system can claim that event A
occured before event B or, if the events fall within the same tick,
that they occured at the same time).
</P>

<P>
Each thread T has three priorities which affect
fairness; the "base priority", the "boosted priority", and the
"effective priority".
<OL>

<LI>The <STRONG>base priority</STRONG> is the value contained in T's
"base priority" field (which is set with the
<CODE>thread-base-priority-set!</CODE> primitive).

<LI>T's "boosted flag" field contains a boolean that affects T's
<STRONG>boosted priority</STRONG>.  When the boosted flag field is
false, the boosted priority is equal to the base priority, otherwise
the boosted priority is equal to the base priority plus the value
contained in T's "priority boost" field (which is set with the
<CODE>thread-priority-boost-set!</CODE> primitive).  The boosted flag
field is set to false when a thread is created, when its quantum
expires, and when <CODE>thread-yield!</CODE> is called.  The boosted
flag field is set to true when a thread blocks.  By carefully choosing
the base priority and priority boost it is possible to set up an
interactive thread so that it has good I/O response time without being
a CPU hog when it performs long computations.

<LI>The <STRONG>effective priority</STRONG> is equal to the maximum of
T's boosted priority and the effective priority of all the threads
that are blocked on a mutex owned by T.  This "priority inheritance"
avoids priority inversion problems that would prevent a high priority
thread blocked at the entry of a critical section to progress because
a low priority thread inside the critical section is preempted for an
arbitrary long time by a medium priority thread.

</OL>
</P>

<P>
Let P(T) be the effective priority of thread T and let R(T) be the
most recent time when one of the following events occurred for thread
T, thus making it runnable: T was started by calling
<CODE>thread-start!</CODE>, T called <CODE>thread-yield!</CODE>, T
expired its quantum, or T was unblocked.  Let the relation NL(T1,T2),
"T1 no later than T2", be true if P(T1)&lt;P(T2) or P(T1)=P(T2) and
R(T1)&gt;R(T2), and false otherwise.  The system must schedule the
execution of threads in such a way that whenever there is at least one
runnable thread, 1) within a finite time at least one thread will be
running, and 2) there is never a pair of runnable threads T1 and T2 for
which NL(T1,T2) is true and T1 is not running and T2 is running.
</P>

<P>
A thread T expires its quantum when an amount of time equal to T's
quantum has elapsed since T entered the running state and T did not
block, terminate or call <CODE>thread-yield!</CODE>.  At that point T
exits the running state to allow other threads to run.  A thread's
quantum is thus an indication of the rate of progress of the thread
relative to the other threads of the same priority.  Moreover, the
resolution of the timer measuring the running time may cause a certain
deviation from the quantum, so a thread's quantum should only be
viewed as an approximation of the time it can run before yielding to
another thread.
</P>

<P>
Threads blocked on a given mutex or condition variable will unblock in
an order which is consistent with decreasing priority and increasing
blocking time (i.e. the highest priority thread unblocks first, and
among equal priority threads the one that blocked first unblocks
first).
</P>
<!--end srfi-21-->

<H4>Memory coherency and lack of atomicity</H4>

<P>
Read and write operations on the store (such as reading and writing a
variable, an element of a vector or a string) are not required to be
atomic.  It is an error for a thread to write a location in the store
while some other thread reads or writes that same location.  It is the
responsibility of the application to avoid write/read and write/write
races through appropriate uses of the synchronization primitives.
</P>

<P>
Concurrent reads and writes to ports are allowed.  It is the
responsibility of the implementation to serialize accesses to a given
port using the appropriate synchronization primitives.
</P>

<H4>Dynamic environments, continuations and <CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE></H4>

<P>
The "dynamic environment" is a structure which allows the system to
find the value returned by <CODE>current-input-port</CODE>,
<CODE>current-output-port</CODE>, etc.  The procedures
<CODE>with-input-from-file</CODE>, <CODE>with-output-to-file</CODE>,
etc extend the dynamic environment to produce a new dynamic
environment which is in effect for the duration of the call to the
thunk passed as the last argument.  Some Scheme systems generalize the
dynamic environment by providing procedures and special forms to
define new "dynamic variables" and bind them in the dynamic
environment (e.g.  <CODE>make-parameter</CODE> and
<CODE>parameterize</CODE>).
</P>

<P>
Each thread has its own dynamic environment.  When a thread's dynamic
environment is extended this does not affect the dynamic environment
of other threads.  When a thread creates a continuation, the thread's
dynamic environment and the <CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> stack are saved
within the continuation (an alternate but equivalent point of view is
that the <CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> stack is part of the dynamic
environment).  When this continuation is invoked the required
<CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> before and after thunks are called and the
saved dynamic environment is reinstated as the dynamic environment of
the current thread.  During the call to each required
<CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> before and after thunk, the dynamic
environment and the <CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> stack in effect when the
corresponding <CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> was executed are reinstated.
Note that this specification clearly defines the semantics of calling
<CODE>call-with-current-continuation</CODE> or invoking a continuation
within a before or after thunk.  The semantics are well defined even
when a continuation created by another thread is invoked.  Below is an
example exercising the subtleties of this semantics.
</P>

<PRE>
    (with-output-to-file
     "foo"
     (lambda ()
       (let ((k (call-with-current-continuation
                 (lambda (exit)
                   (with-output-to-file
                    "bar"
                    (lambda ()
                      (dynamic-wind
                       (lambda () (write '(b1)))
                       (lambda ()
                         (let ((x (call-with-current-continuation
                                   (lambda (cont) (exit cont)))))
                           (write '(t1))
                           x))
                       (lambda () (write '(a1))))))))))
         (if k
             (dynamic-wind
              (lambda () (write '(b2)))
              (lambda ()
                (with-output-to-file
                 "baz"
                 (lambda ()
                   (write '(t2))
                   ; go back inside (with-output-to-file "bar" ...)
                   (k #f))))
              (lambda () (write '(a2))))))))
</PRE>

<P>
In an implementation of Scheme where <CODE>with-output-to-file</CODE>
only closes the port it opened when the thunk returns normally, then
the following actions will occur: <CODE>(b1)(a1)</CODE> is written to
"bar", <CODE>(b2)</CODE> is written to "foo", <CODE>(t2)</CODE> is
written to "baz", <CODE>(a2)</CODE> is written to "foo",
and <CODE>(b1)(t1)(a1)</CODE> is written to "bar".
</P>

<P>
When the scheduler stops the execution of a running thread T1 (whether
because it blocked, expired its quantum, was terminated, etc) and then
resumes the execution of a thread T2, there is in a sense a transfer
of control between T1's current continuation and the continuation of
T2.  This transfer of control by the scheduler does not cause any
<CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> before and after thunks to be called.  It is
only when a thread itself transfers control to a continuation that
<CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> before and after thunks are called.
</P>

<H4>Time objects and timeouts</H4>

<P>
A time object represents a point on the time line.  Its resolution is
implementation dependent (implementations are encouraged to implement
at least millisecond resolution so that precise timing is possible).
Using <CODE>time->seconds</CODE> and <CODE>seconds->time</CODE>, a
time object can be converted to and from a real number which
corresponds to the number of seconds from a reference point on the
time line.  The reference point is implementation dependent and does
not change for a given execution of the program (e.g.  the reference
point could be the time at which the program started).
</P>

<P>
All synchronization primitives which take a timeout parameter accept
three types of values as a timeout, with the following meaning:
<UL>
<LI>a time object represents an absolute point in time
<LI>an exact or inexact real number represents a relative time in
seconds from the moment the primitive was called
<LI><CODE>#f</CODE> means that there is no timeout
</UL>
</P>

<P>
When a timeout denotes the current time or a time in the past, the
synchronization primitive claims that the timeout has been reached
only after the other synchronization conditions have been checked.
Moreover the thread remains running (it does not enter the blocked
state).  For example, <CODE>(mutex-lock! m 0)</CODE> will lock mutex
<CODE>m</CODE> and return <CODE>#t</CODE> if <CODE>m</CODE> is
currently unlocked, otherwise <CODE>#f</CODE> is returned because the
timeout is reached.
</P>

<H4>Primitives and exceptions</H4>

<P>
When one of the primitives defined in this SRFI raises an exception
defined in this SRFI, the exception handler is called with the same
continuation as the primitive (i.e. it is a tail call to the exception
handler).  This requirement avoids having to use
<CODE>call-with-current-continuation</CODE> to get the same effect in
some situations.
</P>

<H4>Primordial thread</H4>

<P>
The execution of a program is initially under the control of a single
thread known as the "primordial thread".  The primordial thread has an
unspecified
<!--begin srfi-21
base priority, priority boost, boosted flag, quantum,
<!--end srfi-21-->
name, specific field, dynamic environment, <CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE>
stack, and exception handler.  All threads are terminated when the
primordial thread terminates (normally or not).
</P>

</PRE><DD>

<P>
    Returns a new thread.  This thread is not automatically made
    runnable (the procedure <CODE>thread-start!</CODE> must be used
    for this).  A thread has the following fields:
<!--begin srfi-21
    base priority, priority boost, boosted flag, quantum,
<!--end srfi-21-->
    name, specific, end-result, end-exception, and a
    list of locked/owned mutexes it owns.  The thread's execution
    consists of a call to <I>thunk</I> with the "initial
    continuation".  This continuation causes the (then) current thread
    to store the result in its end-result field, abandon all mutexes
    it owns, and finally terminate.  The <CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE>
    stack of the initial continuation is empty.  The optional
    <CODE><I>name</I></CODE> is an arbitrary Scheme object which
    identifies the thread (useful for debugging); it defaults to an
    unspecified value.  The specific field is set to an unspecified
    value.
<!--begin thread-group
    The optional <CODE><I>thread-group</I></CODE> indicates which
    thread group this thread belongs to; it defaults to the thread
    group of the current thread.
<!--end thread-group-->
<!--begin srfi-21
    The base priority, priority boost, and quantum of the thread are
    set to the same value as the current thread and the boosted flag
    is set to false.
<!--end srfi-21-->
    The thread inherits the dynamic environment from the current
    thread. Moreover, in this dynamic environment the exception
    handler is bound to the "initial exception handler" which is a
    unary procedure which causes the (then) current thread to store in
    its end-exception field an "uncaught exception" object whose
    "reason" is the argument of the handler, abandon all mutexes it
    owns, and finally terminate.

    NOTE: This operation must be used carefully because it terminates
    a thread abruptly and it is impossible for that thread to perform
    any kind of cleanup.  This may be a problem if the thread is in
    the middle of a critical section where some structure has been put
    in an inconsistent state.  However, another thread attempting to
    enter this critical section will raise an "abandoned mutex
    exception" because the mutex is unlocked/abandoned.  This helps
    avoid observing an inconsistent state.  Clean termination can be obtained
    by polling, as shown in the example below.

<P>
    Unlocks the <CODE><I>mutex</I></CODE> by making it
    unlocked/not-abandoned.  It is not an error to unlock an unlocked
    mutex and a mutex that is owned by any thread.  If
    <CODE><I>condition-variable</I></CODE> is supplied, the current
    thread is blocked and added to the
    <CODE><I>condition-variable</I></CODE> before unlocking
    <CODE><I>mutex</I></CODE>; the thread can unblock at any time but
    no later than when an appropriate call to
    <CODE>condition-variable-signal!</CODE> or
    <CODE>condition-variable-broadcast!</CODE> is performed (see
    below), and no later than the timeout (if
    <CODE><I>timeout</I></CODE> is supplied).  If there are threads
    waiting to lock this <CODE><I>mutex</I></CODE>, the scheduler
    selects a thread, the mutex becomes locked/owned or
    locked/not-owned, and the thread is unblocked.
    <CODE>mutex-unlock!</CODE> returns <CODE>#f</CODE> when the
    timeout is reached, otherwise it returns <CODE>#t</CODE>.
</P>

<P>
    NOTE: The reason the thread can unblock at any time (when
    <CODE><I>condition-variable</I></CODE> is supplied) is to allow
    extending this SRFI with primitives that force a specific blocked
    thread to become runnable.  For example a primitive to interrupt a
    thread so that it performs a certain operation, whether the thread
    is blocked or not, may be useful to handle the case where the
    scheduler has detected a serious problem (such as a deadlock) and
    it must unblock one of the threads (such as the primordial thread)
    so that it can perform some appropriate action.  After a thread
    blocked on a condition-variable has handled such an interrupt it
    would be wrong for the scheduler to return the thread to the
    blocked state, because any calls to
    <CODE>condition-variable-broadcast!</CODE> during the interrupt
    will have gone unnoticed.  It is necessary for the thread to
    remain runnable and return from the call to
    <CODE>mutex-unlock!</CODE> with a result of <CODE>#t</CODE>.
</P>

<P>
    NOTE: <CODE>mutex-unlock!</CODE> is related to the "wait"
    operation on condition variables available in other thread
    systems.  The main difference is that "wait" automatically locks
    <CODE><I>mutex</I></CODE> just after the thread is unblocked.
    This operation is not performed by <CODE>mutex-unlock!</CODE> and
    so must be done by an explicit call to <CODE>mutex-lock!</CODE>.
    This has the advantages that a different timeout and exception
    handler can be specified on the <CODE>mutex-lock!</CODE> and
    <CODE>mutex-unlock!</CODE> and the location of all the mutex
    operations is clearly apparent.  A typical use with a condition
    variable is:
